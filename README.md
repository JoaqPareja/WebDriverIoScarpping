# WebDriverIoScarpping

WebDriverIoSrapping challenge.

To initiate the project after it has been downloaded, just run: npm init wdio . -- --yes

On the project we are using both, protected and public methods.

Public Methods:

 The class defines several public methods that provide higher-level interactions with the web page elements. These methods include:

Protected Methods:

There are also corresponding protected methods with similar names. These protected methods are used to implement the behavior of the public methods. They are meant to be used internally within the class and its child classes and are not intended to be called directly from outside the class.
